            As mental health is becoming increasingly crucial, especially in the past year during the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to create an online mood journal. This website is designed for you to document how you have been feeling and make sure you all are taking care of your mental health. In this, you will be able to enter your feelings. With every day that passes, you are able to see the past entries to monitor your mental health. Your entries will be stored on your local computer and will not be accessed by anyone else.

            Click on one of the two buttons below to check your history of how you have been feeling and make entries! 
            <div class = "wrapper">
              
            
            <a class = "button" href = "./history.html" > <!-- Check History Button - want to change so that it opens up new tab instead of the link-->
                Check History! 
            </a>
            <a class = "button" href = "./entry.html"> <!-- Complete Entry Button - want to change so that it opens a new tab -->
                Complete an Entry!
